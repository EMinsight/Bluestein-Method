# Bluestein-Method

This is a newly-developed algorithm for efficient computation of optical diffraction. Both scalar and vector diffraction can be calculated using this method. Full-path light propagation can be obtained with great flexibility (the region of interest and resolution can be arbitrarily defined) and superior speed.

This algorithm can be used in the fields of optical imaging, holography as well as optical devices design (e.g. phase plates or metasurfaces).
